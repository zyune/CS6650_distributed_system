**The lost update problem**: occurs when two transactions concurrently access the same data and one overwrites the update made by the other. This problem is illustrated in the example of two transactions T and U transferring money to a bank account B, resulting in an incorrect final balance for B when executed concurrently. This happens because both transactions read the same old value of B before either writes a new value, causing the update made by one transaction to be lost.
