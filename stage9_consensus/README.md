What is Consensus algorithms?

- Consensus algorithms are used to ensure that all nodes in the system agree on a common value or decision, even in the presence of faults, failures, or malicious behavior.

Why we need Consensus algorithms in distributed system?

- different nodes may have different views of the system state, and may receive and process different sets of messages. This can lead to inconsistencies and divergent behavior, which can compromise the reliability, consistency, and correctness of the system.

How we reach consensus in distributed system?

- Examples of consensus algorithms include Paxos, Raft, and Byzantine fault tolerance. These algorithms use various techniques, such as leader election, voting, and replication, to achieve consensus among the nodes in the system.
